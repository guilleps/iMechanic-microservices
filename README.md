# iMechanic-architecture-microservices
iMechanic is a cloud-native automotive service platform built using Spring Boot microservices with Angular frontend. The system facilitates interactions between three primary user roles: customers seeking automotive services, mechanics providing services, and workshops managing service operations.

The platform implements a distributed architecture with independent, loosely-coupled services that communicate through well-defined APIs. Service discovery enables dynamic service registration and location, while an API gateway provides a unified entry point for client applications.
